Things to do!

- Fully implement search bar. Almost done - it just randomly reverses the list although it should be descending already

- automatically enlarging text input boxes

- add quotes either at bottom of input page or once item has been inputted using an API

- mood timeline / pie chart + tab --- can't be done without leaving expo go environment.

- structured breathing + tab

- change how the date is displayed for today and yesterday.

- theme selector using async storage.

- add ability to take photos directly from the app and not just upload them

- multi select and multi delete

- settings drawer or page
  -- theme selector
  -- different bullet points
  -- maybe this is where you select how much deep breathing you do?
  --

- style toasts

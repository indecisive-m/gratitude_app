# Things to do!!

# TODO

- mood timeline / pie chart + tab --- can't be done without leaving expo go environment.

- redesign the input and edit screens. They so ugly..

- theme selector using async storage.

- settings drawer or page
  -- theme selector
  -- different bullet points
  -- maybe this is where you select how much deep breathing you do?

- add ability to take photos directly from the app and not just upload them

# started but unfinished

- Fully implement search bar. Almost done - it just randomly reverses the list although it should be descending already.
  -- also need to set flex and width to state so I can reset them when I refresh the list.

- add quotes either at bottom of input page or once item has been inputted using an API
  -- I want to load new quotes when opened and app online. Save 50 to cache and then select from here so no loading screen necessary. Currently fetches from API once submitted.

- structured breathing + tab --- half done. Probably needs improving.

- change how the date is displayed for today and yesterday. Yesterday still won't work for the first of the month.

- style toasts

# Done âœ“

- change from async Storage to Expo SQlite!
- multi select and multi delete
